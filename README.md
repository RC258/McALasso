# Introduction
This repository provides Python code in Jupyter notebook format, designed to be run in the Microsoft Visual Studio environment. This model is applied to any multi-state discrete Markov chains and fulfills the following two objectives:

- The Markov transition matrix estimated by this procedure should closely approximate the true Markov transition matrix.
- For any pair of distinct transitions that exhibit equality relationship in the true Markov transition matrix, this procedure may accurately detect them.
